This repo holds code-related work from a course on Computer Architechture that I did through the [Bradifled School of Computer Science](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/architecture/) from Jan - Feb 2021.

The course covered the following topics:
* The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle
* Lab: Writing a Virtual Machine (I did mine in C)
* Binary Encodings of Data
* Introduction to Assembly Programming
* Intro to Logic Circuits
* Sequential Circuit Components
* The Structure of a Simple CPU
* Introduction to Operating Systems: Booting, Loading, and Virtual Memory
* Lab: Writing a Virtual Operating System
* An Overview of C, the Portable Assembly Language
* Lab: C Programming and Reverse Engineering 
* The Memory Hierarchy

Here's a note from Bradifled on the motivations behind and content of the course:
> Computer architecture—sometimes called “computer organization”—is an important first look at computing from below the software surface. In our experience it is one of the most neglected area among self-taught software engineers.
>
> The course is scoped as an introduction to the topic, designed for software engineers who wish to be better software engineers, rather than prospective hardware engineers.
>
> The focus is on building a strong mental model of the actual execution of programs by a microprocessor, so that you can better reason about the code you write. This manifests most clearly as the ability to write faster code, whether by better understanding the available instruction set, by reasoning more clearly about branch prediction or cache coherence, or by understanding the limits of parallel execution.
