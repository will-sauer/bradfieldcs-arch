## Overview

This repo holds code-related work from a course on Computer Architechture that I did through the [Bradifled School of Computer Science](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/architecture/) from Jan - Feb 2021. Here's a note from Bradifled on the motivations behind and content of the course:
> Computer architecture—sometimes called “computer organization”—is an important first look at computing from below the software surface. In our experience it is one of the most neglected area among self-taught software engineers.
>
> The course is scoped as an introduction to the topic, designed for software engineers who wish to be better software engineers, rather than prospective hardware engineers.
>
> The focus is on building a strong mental model of the actual execution of programs by a microprocessor, so that you can better reason about the code you write. This manifests most clearly as the ability to write faster code, whether by better understanding the available instruction set, by reasoning more clearly about branch prediction or cache coherence, or by understanding the limits of parallel execution.

_Note: I used C throughout the course for no reason other than the practice; was not based on any technical considerations._

There are a ton of inefficiencies in this code. My goal here was not to write "optimized" assembly but rather to familiarize myself with the language and process of writing assembly and solve the problem at hand. if I have time, I may come back to make these more efficient though I think  this level of proficiency is enough to serve my long term goals.
