## Overview

This repo holds code-related work from a course on Computer Architechture that I did through the [Bradifled School of Computer Science](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/architecture/) from Jan - Feb 2021. Here's a note from Bradifled on the motivations behind and content of the course:
> Computer architecture—sometimes called “computer organization”—is an important first look at computing from below the software surface. In our experience it is one of the most neglected area among self-taught software engineers.
>
> The course is scoped as an introduction to the topic, designed for software engineers who wish to be better software engineers, rather than prospective hardware engineers.
>
> The focus is on building a strong mental model of the actual execution of programs by a microprocessor, so that you can better reason about the code you write. This manifests most clearly as the ability to write faster code, whether by better understanding the available instruction set, by reasoning more clearly about branch prediction or cache coherence, or by understanding the limits of parallel execution.

## Completed lab work
* Lab: Writing a Virtual Machine ([repo](https://github.com/will-sauer/bradfieldcs-arch/tree/main/toy-vm))
* Introduction to Assembly Programming ([repo](https://github.com/will-sauer/bradfieldcs-arch/tree/main/MIPS_assembly))

## Additional topics covered
* The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle
* Binary Encodings of Data
* Intro to Logic Circuits
* Sequential Circuit Components
* The Structure of a Simple CPU
* Introduction to Operating Systems: Booting, Loading, and Virtual Memory
* Lab: Writing a Virtual Operating System
* An Overview of C, the Portable Assembly Language
* The Memory Hierarchy


_Notes: I used C throughout the course for no reason other than the practice; was not based on any technical considerations. Also note, there were some sections I skipped (they aren't included in this list) and some labs I didn't complete because they didn't seem totally germane to my longer term goals._
